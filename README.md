This is my 1st attempt at a discord bot that will be written in C#. this bot will be built based on a coupple of already existing bots such
as but not limmited to: Nadeko, Astralmod, Horrizon, DankMemer and so on. This bot will be also based on a pre existing bot that i have 
made over the past year that i am gonna keep anonomus until i am ready to migrate that bot over to this one. as i am preparing my PC to wright
the code bare a few things in mind: 1. this bot is open sorce, 2. no tokens will be given out at any time, and 3 all is appriciated in getting
this bot to work. i might need help when the time comes in me testing it on discord.
